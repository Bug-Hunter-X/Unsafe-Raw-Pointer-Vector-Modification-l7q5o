# Unsafe Raw Pointer Vector Modification in Rust
This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving unsafe raw pointers and vector manipulation.  The code attempts to modify a vector's element using a raw pointer, which can result in unexpected behavior or crashes if not handled carefully. The solution showcases a safer approach using standard library functions.

**Problem:**
Modifying a vector through a raw pointer without proper management can easily invalidate the vector's internal data structures, resulting in undefined behavior, memory corruption, or panics.

**Solution:**
The solution utilizes the standard library's methods for vector manipulation which ensures memory safety and prevents undefined behavior.  It demonstrates using indexing or iterators for safe modifications of vector elements.
